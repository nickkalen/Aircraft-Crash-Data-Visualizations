# Aircraft-Crash-Data-Visualizations
This is a project I completed using the National Transportation Safety Board's [Aviation Accident Database and Synopses](https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx). The datafile contains information on the phase of flight, purpose of flight, type of aircraft, number of deaths, and many other factors on aviation crashes. 

The Aviation Crash Visualization Process is a pdf that walks through my thought process in creating both visualizations. 
The first visualization is interactive and is called How Safe Are You in an Aviation Accident? This was created in Tableau. 
The second visualization is static and is called static-vizzie, and was created using Adobe Illustrator.
