# Aircraft-Crash-Data-Visualizations
This is a project I completed using the National Transportation Safety Board's [Aviation Accident Database and Synopses](https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx). The datafile contains information on the phase of flight, purpose of flight, type of aircraft, number of deaths, and many other factors on aviation crashes. 

File Description:
- VisualizationProcess.pdf: A walkthrough of my thought process in creating both visualizations. 
- AviationAccidents.twbx: An interactive visualization created in Tableau. [Here is a Tableau Public link that may be easier to use](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nick.kalenichenko/viz/HowSafeAreYouinanAviationAccident/Story1).
- StaticVizzie.pdf: A static visualization created with Adobe Illustrator.
- AviationData.csv: The aviation crash dataset
